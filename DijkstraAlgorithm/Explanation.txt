Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It uses a priority queue and a vector to efficiently keep track of the distances to each node.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of Dijkstra's algorithm along with diagrams and C++ code:

Step 1: Initialization

Create a priority queue (min heap) to store the nodes with their distances from the source.
Create a vector to store the distances from the source to each node.
Set the distance of the source node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.
Add the source node to the priority queue with a distance of 0.
Step 2: Main Loop

While the priority queue is not empty, repeat the following steps:
Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue.
Explore all neighboring nodes of the extracted node.
Step 3: Update Distances

For each neighboring node, calculate the tentative distance from the source through the extracted node.
If the tentative distance is smaller than the current distance stored in the vector, update the distance and add the node to the priority queue.
Step 4: Repeat

Continue the main loop until all nodes have been explored or the target node is reached.
Step 5: Path Reconstruction (optional)

If you need to find the shortest path itself, you can trace back from the target node to the source node using the vector of previous nodes.
